# Why do we use TileMap.h?

In game explanation:
* Every `map` contains  a **matrix** of char
* Every char represents an element of our game
    * Defined on `TileMap.h`
* The **matrix** generated always have an solution
    * An solution is defined by a conection of **two** or **more** doors.
    * Every `map ` can be generated by a different algorithm
        * Drunkard
        * RadialHunter
* The map can be:
    * Fight Map
    * Boss Map
    * Treasure Map
* The clear flag means that the `player` have already beated this map.

The structure `map` can be visualized like this:
__Visualization of map__

```
    tile ** map;
    int size_x;
    int size_y;
    TileMap * up;
    TileMap * down;
    TileMap * left;
    TileMap * right;
    bool cleared;
    bool store;
    bool boss;
```
To use `TileMap.h` you need to set `size x and size y`. And choose an algorithm to generate.
Example:
```
 TileMap * mapa = new TileMap(13, 33);
 mapa->generateAlgorithmDrunkardWalk();
```
You can use this class alone, but we recommend you to use the class `Floor.h` that handle the class `TileMap`.
